# Project Requirements and Specifications

## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a digital assistant for the Santali language. The assistant will provide functionalities such as speech recognition, natural language processing, text-to-speech synthesis, and knowledge management tailored to Santali speakers.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Language Understanding
- Build a comprehensive understanding of Santali language nuances, including grammar rules, vocabulary, and cultural context.
- Support various dialects of Santali, if applicable.

### 2. Speech Recognition
- Develop or integrate speech recognition software to accurately interpret spoken Santali commands and queries.
- Ensure high accuracy in noisy environments.

### 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Create NLP models that can process and generate text in Santali, understanding intent and context.
- Include features like sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and language translation (Santali to other languages and vice versa).

### 4. Database and Knowledge Base
- Populate a database with relevant information tailored to Santali speakersâ€™ needs and interests.
- Create and manage a knowledge base that the assistant can query to provide accurate information.

### 5. Voice Synthesis
- Implement text-to-speech technology to convert Santali text into spoken words with natural-sounding voices.
- Provide options for different voices and accents.

### 6. Platform Integration
- Ensure compatibility across various platforms (web, mobile, smart devices).
- Provide APIs for third-party integrations.

### 7. Testing and Iteration
- Continuously test the assistant with Santali speakers to refine its understanding, responsiveness, and accuracy.
- Collect user feedback and make iterative improvements.

### 8. Localization
- Localize the assistant to handle regional dialects and cultural variations of the Santali language.
- Ensure the assistant respects cultural norms and practices.

### 9. Privacy and Security
- Implement robust security measures to protect user data and ensure privacy.
- Comply with relevant data protection regulations and standards.

### 10. Deployment and Support
- Provide comprehensive support for users during and after deployment.
- Gather and analyze feedback to make ongoing improvements.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance
- The assistant should respond to user queries within 2 seconds.
- The system should handle at least 10,000 concurrent users.

### 2. Scalability
- The architecture should support scaling to accommodate a growing number of users and data.

### 3. Reliability
- The system should have 99.9% uptime.
- Implement failover mechanisms and backups to ensure data integrity.

### 4. Usability
- The interface should be user-friendly and accessible to Santali speakers of all ages and technical proficiencies.
- Provide clear and concise documentation and help resources.

### 5. Maintainability
- The codebase should be well-documented and modular to facilitate easy maintenance and updates.
- Implement automated testing and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

## Technical Specifications
